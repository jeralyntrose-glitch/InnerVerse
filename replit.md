# Overview

InnerVerse is a FastAPI-based PDF Q&A application designed for intelligent knowledge retrieval from uploaded documents. It enables users to upload PDFs via a modern web interface, transcribe audio and YouTube videos into searchable PDFs, and generate document reports. The core functionality involves chunking, embedding, and storing document content in Pinecone, then leveraging OpenAI's GPT models for answering user queries. The application also provides robust API usage monitoring with real-time cost tracking and rate limiting, offering an intuitive and efficient experience for document interaction.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Interface**: Single-page application with a glassmorphic UI, animated SVG brain icon, purple gradient theme, and a live visual cost tracker.
- **Theme System**: Light/Dark mode toggle with persistence.
- **Upload Flow**: Supports drag-and-drop PDF uploads, Google Drive integration, and YouTube MP3 transcription with progress tracking and persistent error notifications. Mobile-optimized.
- **Tag Library**: Cloud-based visual tag library with interactive tag clouds, frequency counts, document browsing by tags, and a document rename feature. Supports filtering by single-clicking tags and auto-filling chat with questions by double-clicking.
- **Chat Flow**: iPhone-style chat interface for document Q&A and management via commands (e.g., `list docs`, `delete doc [id]`). Answers are generated by GPT models across all uploaded documents.
- **Claude Master Interface** (`/claude`): Advanced conversational workspace powered by Claude Sonnet 4 with a production-ready ChatGPT-style interface. Features 7 organized project categories, persistent conversations stored in PostgreSQL, and a ChatGPT-style sidebar with full-height design. Responsive design (fixed position on desktop with 260px width, overlay mode on mobile with close button). Includes a welcome screen with suggested prompts and robust state management. Security features include HTML escaping to prevent XSS. Integrates automatic InnerVerse backend queries and web search capabilities via Claude API function calling. Supports PWA for mobile installation.
  - **ChatGPT-Style Sidebar**: Fixed-position full-height (100dvh) sidebar with light gray background (#f7f7f8). Top section contains search bar and new chat icon button. Navigation includes "ChatGPT" home button and collapsible "Projects" section with chevron icon. User profile footer at bottom. Smooth 250ms cubic-bezier animations for all transitions. Mobile features: close button (X) in top-right, click-outside-to-close with backdrop, auto-close when selecting conversations. Desktop: always visible at 260px width, push mode layout. Tablet (768-1024px): push mode. Mobile (<768px): overlay mode with 280px width (max 85vw).
  - **Browser History Routing**: Full browser back/forward button support using HTML5 History API. Back button navigates within app hierarchy (Chat → Project → Home) without exiting. Each navigation action (openProject, openConversation, showHomeView) pushes history state with pushState. popstate listener handles browser navigation events to restore correct view state.
  - **Conversation List**: ChatGPT-style compact design with single-line items, timestamps on right (e.g., "now", "5m", "2h", "Jan 15"), and delete functionality. Each item shows conversation name with ellipsis truncation, timestamp, and trash icon button. Delete requires confirmation dialog. Active conversation highlighted with persistent background color (var(--bg-active)) that survives hover states. Hover effects only apply to non-active items to preserve visual selection. Instant navigation with loading spinner (<200ms) - no artificial delays.
  - **Auto-Expanding Textarea**: Input grows from 40px (1 line) to 120px (5 lines) maximum, with debounced scrollbar updates for smooth performance.
  - **Streaming Responses**: Typewriter effect displays AI responses in 5-character chunks every 8ms with optimized scrolling (every 10 chunks) for engaging, performant UX.
  - **iOS Optimization**: iPhone 14 Pro optimized with viewport locking (position: fixed + overscroll-behavior) to prevent page sliding while preserving native scrolling in message containers. Input bar positioned with `calc(12px + env(safe-area-inset-bottom))` for proper safe area handling.
  - **Thinking Indicator**: Subtle breathing/pulsing indicator (8px blue dot with "thinking" text) appears bottom-right during AI processing to maintain user engagement (ADHD-friendly design).
  - **Offline Resilience**: PWA-optimized message persistence handles interrupted API calls gracefully. Messages are saved to localStorage before sending with unique IDs, marked as failed on error, and automatically present retry UI on app resume. Handles iOS app backgrounding, duplicate messages (e.g., "Yes", "OK"), and includes XSS protection via textContent rendering. Visibility change and pageshow listeners detect app resume to restore failed messages.
  - **Performance**: DOM element caching, parallel API fetches, debounced input handlers, optimized rendering with fade-in effects, instant conversation/project switching with non-blocking background loads, and single-fetch architecture eliminating duplicate network requests.

## Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: FastAPI with asynchronous operations.
- **Runtime**: Python with Uvicorn ASGI server.
- **Design Pattern**: Stateless API where `document_id` is managed by the frontend.
- **Deployment**: VM deployment with health checks, robust database initialization, and detailed logging.
- **API Usage and Cost Tracking**: Logs and persists OpenAI API call costs to PostgreSQL, accessible via `/api/usage`, with a rate limit of 100 requests per hour.

## Document Processing Pipeline
- **PDF Parsing**: Uses PyPDF2 for text extraction, supporting encrypted PDFs.
- **Text Chunking**: LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` for overlapping text chunks.
- **InnerVerse Intelligence Layer**: Automatic MBTI/Jungian taxonomy tagging using GPT-3.5, storing tags in Pinecone metadata.
- **YouTube MP3 Transcription**: Processes uploaded audio (MP3, M4A, WAV, MP4) up to 24MB via OpenAI Whisper API, generates formatted PDFs using ReportLab, auto-tags, and indexes in Pinecone.
- **Text to PDF**: Converts text to formatted PDFs with GPT-3.5 for punctuation and grammar fixes.
- **Reprocess PDF**: Enhances existing Whisper-transcribed PDFs by extracting text, cleaning with GPT-3.5, and returning an improved PDF.
- **Large File Support**: Efficient binary uploads and batch processing for Pinecone upserts.

## Vector Storage Strategy

## API Structure
- **Upload**: `POST /upload`, `POST /upload-base64` (PDFs), `POST /upload-audio` (audio).
- **Query**: `POST /query`.
- **Text/PDF Processing**: `POST /text-to-pdf`, `POST /reprocess-pdf`.
- **Document Management**: `GET /documents/report`, `DELETE /documents/{document_id}`, `DELETE /documents/all`, `PATCH /documents/{document_id}/rename`, chat commands.
- **Claude Chat API**: Endpoints for managing project categories, conversations, messages, and searching.
- **Usage Monitoring**: `/api/usage`.
- **Static Files**: Serves frontend assets and Swagger UI documentation.
- **PWA Support**: Service worker, manifest, and icons for mobile installation.
- **CORS**: Enabled for all origins.

## Configuration Management
