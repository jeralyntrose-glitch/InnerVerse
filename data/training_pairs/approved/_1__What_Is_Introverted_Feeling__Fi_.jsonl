{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is introverted feeling and what does it focus on?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Introverted feeling (Fi) is one of the four decision-making cognitive functions, and it focuses on morals. It's linked to extroverted thinking (Te) on an axis, creating a dynamic between personal moral judgment and external logical systems. This means Fi users make decisions based on their internal moral compass rather than external logical frameworks."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do Fi users make decisions differently from Te users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fi users base decisions on what they feel is good or bad, not on what is true or false. This contrasts sharply with Te users who rely on external sources and majority rules for decision-making. The difference is fundamental - Fi is about internal moral judgment while Te is about external verification and consensus."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Which personality types use introverted feeling?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fi users include ESTJ, ENTJ, ESFP, ENFP, ISTJ, INTJ, ISFP, and INFP. These eight types all have Fi somewhere in their function stack, though its position varies - if Te is dominant, then Fi is inferior. This means half of all types use the Fi-Te axis for decision-making."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the difference between the external and internal aspects of feeling judgment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Introverted feeling involves personal judgment, with the external aspect known as ethics and the introverted aspect dealing with morals. This distinction matters because it separates what society considers ethical behavior from what an individual personally judges as morally good or bad. Fi is specifically about that personal value judgment where individuals perceive things as good or bad based on their internal compass."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do INFPs typically behave and what happens when they're pushed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "INFPs are typically gentle and deliberate in their actions, prioritizing their emotions and experiences and seeking comfort and positive feelings. However, when pushed out of their comfort zone, an INFP's Fi hero emerges, signaling discomfort and prompting action. This shift shows how the Hero function activates when boundaries are crossed, transforming their gentle nature into something more assertive."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the relationship between Ti Fe users and Fi users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ti Fe users, who emphasize logic and ethics, serve to balance Te Fi users, while Fi users act as moral guides for Ti Fe users. This dynamic allows for ethical behavior to emerge as Ti Fe users absorb and integrate the emotions of Fi users, fostering ethical considerations. It's a complementary relationship where each axis provides what the other lacks - logic and ethics versus morals and external verification."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does moral decision-making work for Fi users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Moral decision-making power typically involves assessing one's feelings towards a situation rather than just thoughts. Introverted feeling isn't about logic; it's more about what others think, as it involves rationale. This means Fi users process decisions through their emotional and moral lens first, determining whether something feels right or wrong before considering logical implications."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do Fi users seek others' opinions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "An Fi user seeks others' opinions to align with their own feelings and judgments, not because they lack moral awareness. They find comfort and security in information provided by credentialed individuals, even if it may lack accuracy. This is fundamentally different from someone with Fi trickster who seeks opinions due to low moral awareness - Fi users are validating their existing moral stance rather than trying to develop one."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the Hero function operate?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Hero function operates optimistically - it's always on and runs at full speed. There's no off switch for your Hero function, which means it's constantly engaged and operating at maximum capacity. This relentless, optimistic operation is what drives the Hero to be perpetually active in its domain."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do Se Heroes respond to their surroundings?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Se Heroes react immediately to their environment. This instant reactivity means they're constantly processing and responding to the physical world around them in real-time. That immediate response is the Se Hero function in action, always engaged and operating at full speed."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does introverted feeling focus on?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Introverted feeling focuses on personal beliefs of right and wrong - it's essentially your moral compass. Individuals with strong introverted feeling make quick judgments based on their feelings, though they often keep these judgments to themselves rather than expressing them outwardly. This internal moral framework guides their decisions and evaluations of situations."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do people with lower introverted feeling make decisions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Those with lower introverted feeling prioritize rational decisions over moral ones. Instead of leading with their personal sense of right and wrong, they focus on logical considerations when making choices. This means their decision-making process is less influenced by internal moral judgments and more driven by rational analysis."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do ENTJs and ESTJs experience conflicts in their interactions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The desire for order in personality types like ENTJs and ESTJs can be misunderstood as excessive control, which causes conflicts in their interactions. What they see as necessary structure and organization, others may perceive as controlling behavior. This misunderstanding creates friction because their drive for order is interpreted negatively by those around them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What do introverted feelers crave socially?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Introverted feelers enjoy being in the spotlight, craving fame and status. They seek self-affirmation and desire recognition from others, much like rational individuals do. This need for external validation and social recognition drives their behavior, even though their feeling function is introverted and focused on internal moral judgments."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do people with extroverted feeling interact with Fi users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Those with extroverted feeling connect with Fi users by tailoring their interactions based on how an Fi user would typically feel in a given situation. They're essentially adapting to or strategizing around Fi users, which amounts to manipulating the social dynamics. People who perceive themselves as socially adept are really just adapting their behavior to work with Fi users' internal moral frameworks."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do ENFPs approach thought and feelings?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "ENFPs prioritize thought manipulation and feelings due to their introverted thinking trickster, which values logic over morality. This means their approach to thinking is influenced by their trickster function, causing them to focus on manipulating thoughts and prioritizing feelings in ways that might not align with strict logical frameworks. Their introverted thinking trickster creates a unique relationship with logic that differs from types with stronger Te or Ti."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What do FITE users focus on regarding truth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "FITE users focus on what is believed to be true rather than actual truth, and they can influence others' beliefs and eventually adopt them. This tendency to prioritize believed truth over actual truth is more common in Te child or Te inferior types rather than Te hero or Te parent types. Their focus on belief rather than objective truth means they're more susceptible to shaping and being shaped by what people think is true."}]}
