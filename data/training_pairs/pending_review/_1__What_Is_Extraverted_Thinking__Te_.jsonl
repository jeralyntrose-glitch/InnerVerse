{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is extraverted thinking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Te is rational thinking - making decisions based on data, statistics, patterns, and what other people think. It's not about what's actually true. It's about what the majority says is true. Te users are thought vampires - they absorb external reference points constantly because they can't produce enough true/false judgments on their own. That's why it's extraverted. They need outside sources."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the difference between Te and Ti?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Te is rational - decisions based on external data, votes, majority rules, what others think. Ti is logical - decisions based on what's actually true inside your own head. Te users care about credentials and sources. Ti users don't give a damn about your degree - they want to know if it's actually true. Te is groupthink. Ti is personal truth."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Which types have Te in their ego?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "ESTJ, ENTJ, ISTJ, and INTJ have Te hero or parent. Then you've got ENFP, ESFP, ISFP, and INFP with Te child or inferior. All eight of these types make decisions based on rationale - some more than others. The TJs lead with it. The FPs have it lower in their stack but still use rational thinking for decisions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Te actually make decisions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Picture ten tables in your mind. Each table has a true or false judgment happening simultaneously. Six could be true, four false - or eight false and two true. Whatever the majority says wins. That's your decision. It's not about arriving at actual truth. It's about what the collective data points say. The majority rules - always."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do Te users care so much about credentials?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because Te needs external sources to validate its judgments. Credentials are proof that someone is a legitimate reference point worth absorbing thoughts from. A degree, certification, title - these tell Te users who's smart and worth listening to. Without credentials, you're dismissed. With them, you're a valid data source. It's how they determine which thoughts to vampire."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it mean that Te users are thought vampires?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "They feed on other people's thoughts constantly. They surround themselves with smart people - or who they believe are smart - and absorb all their ideas. Then they combine those borrowed thoughts in their head and project them back out. That's why ENFPs like Tai Lopez read a book a day. They need constant external reference points to feel intelligent."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is Te child like in ENFPs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Te child is in the third slot for ENFPs. It's all about rational thinking and feeding on knowledge. That's why you see ENFPs constantly reading, joining book clubs, collecting mentors, citing sources. They're filling their minds with reference points so when they express a thought, they're borrowing from many people and combining them into something that feels like theirs."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Te relate to groupthink?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Te is inherently susceptible to groupthink. Since decisions are based on what the collective says - majority rules - Te users follow the group. They value what others believe over independent verification. If the majority says something is true, it becomes true for them. They're not asking if it's actually true. They're asking what the consensus is."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are Te users sensitive to public criticism?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because their self-worth comes from external validation. Te users base their value on what others think of them. Public criticism destroys that. It challenges their status, their credentials, their perceived intelligence in front of their reference group. They'll either withdraw completely or defend themselves aggressively with more evidence and sources to prove you wrong."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the connection between Te and status?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Te thrives on status. They want the spotlight, the recognition, the title. Status proves they're valuable in the eyes of others - which is everything to Te. They actively seek qualifications and certifications to elevate their position. Higher status means more credibility, which means their thoughts matter more in the collective judgment process."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do Te users view people without credentials?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "They diminish them. If you don't have the credentials, your opinion doesn't matter. Te users will emphasize their own educational background or certifications to establish intellectual superiority. No degree? Not worth listening to. Haven't read the books? Your thoughts are invalid. They need external proof that someone is a legitimate source before they'll absorb anything from them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What types have Te hero?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "ESTJ and ENTJ. Te hero means rationale is their primary decision-making function. They're leading with external data, metrics, statistics, what works. ESTJ is the Judicator. ENTJ is the Marshal. Both are highly focused on rational efficiency and collecting reference points to make the best decisions based on collective information."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is Te parent like in ISTJs and INTJs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Te parent is the responsible, dutiful side of rational thinking. ISTJs and INTJs use Te to take care of others through systems, metrics, and proven methods. They're the ones memorizing reference points, citing sources for everything, building frameworks based on collective data. Te parent wants to provide structure and understanding through external validation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do Te users read so much?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Books are external reference points. Every book is a source of thoughts to absorb, data to collect, patterns to recognize. Te users read constantly to enhance their intelligence - not by thinking for themselves, but by feeding on the collective wisdom of others. The more they read, the more reference points they have, the smarter they feel."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the difference between Te making someone smart versus Ti?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Te users feel smart by surrounding themselves with smart people and absorbing their thoughts. Their intelligence is borrowed - a combination of external sources. Ti users feel smart by verifying truth independently inside their own head. Te is about appearing intelligent through credentials and references. Ti is about being intelligent through independent logical verification."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Te inferior show up in INFPs and ISFPs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Te inferior is aspirational rational thinking. INFPs and ISFPs struggle with metrics, external validation, and understanding what others think is true. They aspire to be taken seriously by the collective, to have credentials that matter, to make decisions based on data instead of just their values. But it's their weakest function - insecure and underdeveloped."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does Te look like in social settings?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Te users seek approval constantly. They base their self-worth on external opinions - how others perceive them socially. They maintain a positive image among peers because that's where their value comes from. Challenge them publicly and watch them crumble or defend aggressively. Their status in the group determines how they feel about themselves."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can you give examples of famous Te users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Donald Trump - ENTJ with Te hero. Tai Lopez - ENFP with Te child, always reading books and citing mentors. Gary Vaynerchuk - ENFP with Te child, constantly absorbing and regurgitating business wisdom from external sources. All of them surround themselves with smart people, collect reference points, and project borrowed thoughts as their own insights."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do Te users care what the majority thinks?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because majority rules is literally how Te makes decisions. If six out of ten mental tables say true, the decision is true. It's not about actual truth - it's about consensus. Te can't produce enough true/false judgments internally, so it relies on external sources. The majority becomes the truth. That's rational thinking."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What happens when you criticize a Te user?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Depends on the situation. Public criticism? They're devastated because their value comes from external perception. They'll either withdraw to protect their ego or fight back hard with more evidence, more credentials, more sources to prove their intelligence and status. Private criticism? Still defensive, but less dramatic. Either way, you're challenging their externally-derived self-worth."}]}
