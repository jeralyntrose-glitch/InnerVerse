{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are cognitive functions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Eight different ways your mind tunes into reality. Four gather information - those are your perceiving functions. Four make decisions - those are your judging functions. Think of them like radio frequencies your brain picks up. You've got access to all eight through your ego and shadow, but you can only use four at a time per side of your mind. The hierarchy matters - your hero function runs at 100 frames per second while your inferior limps along at 25."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why can't I be good at everything?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because you only get four cognitive functions in your ego. That's it. Your mind can only tune into half the bandwidth at once. An ENTP gets Ne-Ti-Fe-Si. An ISTJ gets Si-Te-Fi-Ne. Completely different channels. This is why human relationships matter - you need other people to cover the frequencies you're blind to. No type is superior. Every type is balanced with specific strengths and specific weaknesses."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How fast do cognitive functions process information?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your hero function processes at 100 frames per second - that's your fastest, sharpest awareness. Parent runs at 75 frames per second. Child hits 50. Your inferior function drags at 25 frames per second - which is why you're so damn insecure about it. Then your shadow drops even lower. Nemesis sits at 20 frames per second. This speed hierarchy explains why you default to your hero and why your inferior feels so uncomfortable."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the hero function?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What you do best. Your default mode. Your comfort zone. It's the first cognitive function in your ego stack and runs at maximum capacity - 100 frames per second of pure awareness. For an ENTP, that's Ne. For an ISTJ, that's Si. For an ENFJ, that's Fe. This is where you live most of the time. It's your strongest tool and your primary lens for viewing reality."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the parent function do?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your parent function criticizes your hero. It offers warnings, points out consequences, asks \"but what about this?\" It's protective but also restrictive. For an ENTP with Ti parent, it's constantly fact-checking that Ne hero's wild ideas. For an ISTJ with Te parent, it's organizing and applying all that Si hero memory. Parent runs at 75 frames per second - strong enough to keep your hero in check."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is the child function so important?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because it's the most innocent part of your mind. Attack someone's child function and you're doing psychological damage. It's where joy lives, where play happens, where you feel most\u7d14 and unguarded. For an ENTP, that's Fe child - they want to make people happy and feel crushed when they fail. Hurt someone's child function and you've hurt them at their core. It processes at 50 frames per second - slower than hero or parent, but still pretty aware."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the inferior function and why does it matter?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your fourth function - where all your insecurity lives. It runs at only 25 frames per second, so you're slow and clumsy with it. For an ENTP, that's Si - they're insecure about duty, memory, and past experiences. For an ISTJ, that's Ne - they're terrified of future possibilities. Everyone has an inferior function, which means everyone has insecurities tied to a specific cognitive function. You can't escape it. You can only develop it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I figure out someone's type from their functions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Identify the first two functions and you've got it. The pattern is locked in. If someone has Ne hero and Ti parent, they're ENTP. Done. Why? Because Ne is extroverted, so the second function must be introverted. Ne's opposite is Si, so that goes in the inferior slot. Ti's opposite is Fe, so that's the child. Every function has a polar opposite - hero opposes inferior, parent opposes child. Once you know two functions, the logic reveals the rest."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the difference between extroverted and introverted feeling?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fe is awareness of how other people feel - ethics, empathy, absorbing the emotional temperature of the room. High Fe types are caring, empathetic, and tune into everyone else's feelings. Fi is caring directed inward - your own values, morals, what matters to you personally. Fi is the source of caring. Fe needs Fi to mirror and express. Fe asks \"how do they feel?\" Fi asks \"how do I feel about this?\" Completely different channels."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the nemesis function do?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fifth function - where your worries live. It runs at 20 frames per second, so it's even slower than your inferior. The nemesis creates anxiety about the opposite of your hero function. ENTP with Ne hero? Their nemesis is Ni - they worry about what they want and their destiny. INTJ with Ni hero? Their nemesis is Ne - they worry about all the possibilities they're missing. Nemesis is your shadow's hero, and it haunts you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the critic function?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sixth slot - where you criticize yourself. This is brutal self-judgment territory. If you have Fi critic like an ENTP, you constantly question your own worth and need validation. If you have Te critic like an INTJ, you tear apart your own reasoning and metrics. If you have Fe critic like an ISTJ, you criticize how you make others feel. The critic is relentless and it's aimed directly at you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What the hell is the trickster function?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Seventh function - your blind spot. This is where you're completely unaware. For most people, the trickster represents a cognitive function they just don't register. ENTP with Se trickster? They're oblivious to their physical surroundings and performance in the moment. ISFJ with Te trickster? They can't see the logical systems right in front of them. You're not just weak here - you're genuinely blind. Other people can manipulate you through your trickster and you won't even see it coming."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the demon function?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Eighth function - the most destructive force in your mind. It's the source of human corruption and the worst aspects of your personality. When your demon activates, you become your most toxic self. ENTP with Fi demon? They'll destroy people's self-worth when threatened. ESFJ with Ti demon? They'll eviscerate someone with cold logic when cornered. The demon is powerful but corrosive. It's your last resort and using it damages both you and everyone around you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do the ego and shadow relate?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your shadow is your ego flipped. Same functions, opposite attitudes. ESFJ ego is Fe-Si-Ne-Ti. Their shadow is Fi-Se-Ni-Te - that's ISFP. Every function inverts. Extroverted becomes introverted. Your hero's opposite becomes your nemesis. Your parent's opposite becomes your critic. Your child's opposite becomes your trickster. Your inferior's opposite becomes your demon. The shadow contains the same functions you use in your ego, just reversed and running through your unconscious mind."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do I need to know cognitive functions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because it tells you everything. Where you're strong. Where you're weak. Where you're insecure. Where you're blind. How you gather information and make decisions. How you interact with others. An ENTP processes reality completely differently than an ISTJ - different speeds, different channels, different defaults. Once you know someone's functions, you understand their awareness levels, their communication style, their insecurities, their strengths. You can finally stop wondering why someone doesn't think like you do. They literally can't. Different functions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the difference between a judging and perceiving type?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Judging types have a decision-making function as their hero. ENFJ has Fe hero. ENTJ has Te hero. ESTJ has Te hero. Their first function makes judgments. Perceiving types have an information-gathering function as their hero. ENTP has Ne hero. ESTP has Se hero. ENFP has Ne hero. Their first function perceives data. This determines whether you lead with gathering information or making decisions. Judging types organize and decide first. Perceiving types explore and gather first."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I identify an ESFJ's cognitive functions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Start with the letters. ESFJ is extroverted, so hero function is extroverted. It's a judging type with F, so hero is Fe. Second function alternates attitude - that's introverted sensing, Si parent. Hero and inferior are opposites, so Fe hero means Ti inferior in the fourth slot. Parent and child are opposites, so Si parent means Ne child in the third slot. Ego done - Fe, Si, Ne, Ti. Shadow flips everything - Fi, Se, Ni, Te. That makes their shadow an ISFP."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it mean that cognitive functions are like radio frequencies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your mind is a transceiver - it sends and receives data across eight different spectrums. Each cognitive function tunes into one specific frequency. Ne picks up future possibilities. Si picks up past experiences. Te picks up logical systems. Fi picks up personal values. You can only tune into four frequencies at a time through your ego. The other four sit in your shadow. Everyone's tuning into different channels at different speeds, which is why people perceive and process reality so damn differently."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I access all eight cognitive functions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, but only four at a time per side of your mind. Your ego gives you access to four functions. Your shadow gives you access to the other four. You can also tap into your subconscious and unconscious simultaneously to access different combinations. But you're still limited - you can't run all eight at full capacity at once. Your mind can only handle half the bandwidth in any given moment. This is why you need other people. They're tuned into the frequencies you're not."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why does the inferior function cause so much insecurity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because it processes at only 25 frames per second - a quarter of your hero's speed. You're painfully aware you're bad at it. ENTP with Si inferior feels insecure about their memory, duty, and past mistakes. INTJ with Se inferior feels insecure about their physical performance and living in the moment. Your inferior is slow, clumsy, and unreliable. You know it. Everyone else knows it. That's where your deepest insecurities live - tied directly to the cognitive function you're worst at."}]}
