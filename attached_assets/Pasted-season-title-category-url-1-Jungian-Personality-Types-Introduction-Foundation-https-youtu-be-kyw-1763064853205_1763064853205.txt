### **Q2: Matching algorithm priorities?**

**YES - Season match FIRST, then title similarity.** ✅

**Matching Logic (in order):**

1. **Extract season number** from both video and PDF
   - Video: `[1]`, `[17.1]`, `[20]` 
   - PDF: Look for same pattern in filename/title

2. **IF season matches** → Calculate title similarity (70%+ = confident match)

3. **IF season doesn't match** → Skip (don't match across different seasons)

**Why this order:**
- Season is most reliable identifier
- Prevents cross-season mismatches
- Title alone isn't enough (many videos have similar titles)

**Example:**
```
Video: [17.1] Alpha Quadra - Crusaders
PDF: [17] Alpha Quadra Crusaders - Framework ESFJ ENTP ISFJ INTP

Season match? ✅ (both 17.x)
Title similarity? ✅ (85% - "Alpha Quadra Crusaders")
Result: HIGH CONFIDENCE MATCH

## **🤔 USER EXPERIENCE QUESTIONS:**

### **Q3: Auto-play or manual start?**

**MANUAL START** ✅

**Reasoning:**
- User might be on mobile with limited data
- User might prefer reading transcript first
- Auto-play can be annoying/intrusive
- YouTube default behavior (user clicks play)

**Implementation:** Standard YouTube embed (no autoplay parameter)

---

### **Q4: Transcript visible by default or collapsed?**

**COLLAPSED BY DEFAULT** ✅

**Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                     │
│     [YOUTUBE VIDEO PLAYER]          │
│         (takes up space)            │
│                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 📄 Transcript ▼ (Click to expand)   │  ← COLLAPSED
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Reasoning:**
- Video is primary content (most users will watch)
- Transcript is backup/reference
- Collapsed = cleaner UI, less scrolling
- Easy to expand if user wants it

**If NO video exists:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📄 Transcript ▼ (Click to expand)   │  ← STILL collapsed
│                                     │
│ (Lesson content below)              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

## **📋 SUMMARY FOR REPLIT:**

**Tell them:**
```
Great questions! Here are the answers:

1. CSV FILE: Yes, ready. I have youtube_links_master.csv with 310 videos 
   (season, title, category, url). Where should I upload it?

2. MATCHING ALGORITHM: 
   Priority order:
   - Step 1: Extract season number (e.g., 1, 17.1, 20)
   - Step 2: IF seasons match → Calculate title similarity
   - Step 3: IF similarity ≥ 70% → Potential match
   - Step 4: IF similarity < 70% or seasons don't match → No match
   
   Only match videos to PDFs within the same season.

3. VIDEO PLAYER: Manual start (no autoplay)
   - User clicks play button to start
   - Standard YouTube embed behavior

4. TRANSCRIPT: Collapsed by default
   - Show "📄 Transcript ▼" toggle
   - User clicks to expand
   - Cleaner UI, video takes focus
