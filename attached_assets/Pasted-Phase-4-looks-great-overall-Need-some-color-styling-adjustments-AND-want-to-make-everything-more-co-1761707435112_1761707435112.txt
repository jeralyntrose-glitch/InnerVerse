Phase 4 looks great overall! Need some color/styling adjustments AND want to make everything more compact/sleek:

**STYLING PHILOSOPHY:**
Make the interface thinner, sleeker, more minimalist - BUT keep the chat area comfortable and usable (not cramped at bottom).

**Issues to fix:**

1. Header Bar (Top of Page):
   - Currently: Big fat purple bar
   - Change to: THIN minimal header (max 50px height) OR remove entirely
   - Background: White or very light grey (#F7F7F8)
   - Sleek, barely-there feel
   - Should NOT dominate the screen

2. New Chat Button (Sidebar):
   - Currently: Purple button, likely chunky
   - Change to: 
     * Thin, sleek button design
     * Reduced padding (8px vertical, 12px horizontal)
     * Background: White or light grey with subtle 1px border
     * Text color: Dark grey (#2D2D2D)
     * Hover state: Light teal (#E6F7F4)
     * Should be compact, not bulky

3. Sidebar Overall:
   - Make everything more compact
   - Reduce padding/spacing between elements
   - Folders: Tighter spacing
   - Chat list items: Sleeker, less padding
   - Overall: Thin, tight, professional feel

4. Send Button (Bottom Right):
   - Currently: Practically black, hard to see
   - Change to:
     * Teal (#10A37F) background
     * Compact size (not huge)
     * Sleek design
     * Hover state: Darker teal (#0D8C6C)
     * Should be visible but not dominating

5. User Messages (My Messages):
   - Currently: Grey rectangle spanning full width
   - Should be: 
     * Small teal bubble (#10A37F)
     * Right-aligned
     * Max-width: 60% (slightly smaller than before)
     * Compact padding: 10px 14px (tighter)
     * Border-radius: 16px
     * Sleek bubble feel

6. Message Input Area (Bottom):
   - Keep it functional and usable
   - Reduce overall height to be sleeker
   - BUT: Don't make it cramped or tiny
   - Input box should still be comfortable to type in
   - Send button integrated nicely
   - Thin but usable

7. Overall Spacing:
   - Reduce padding throughout
   - Tighter margins between messages (12px instead of 16px)
   - More compact feel overall
   - BUT: Keep readability - don't make it claustrophobic

**GOAL:**
Sleek, thin, minimalist, professional aesthetic - like a high-end productivity tool. Everything compact but still usable. Think: "Apple design language" - minimal, tight, refined.

**CRITICAL:**
- Chat area should NOT feel cramped
- Input box at bottom should still be comfortable to use
- Just make all the chrome/UI elements thinner and tighter
- The content (messages) should breathe, the UI should be minimal

Please adjust these items while maintaining the good parts (AI full-width messages, markdown rendering, etc.)
