REMOVE AXIS BACKEND FROM LESSON CHAT - STREAM DIRECTLY

PROBLEM:
Lesson tutor chat goes through AXIS backend which buffers responses.
We don't need AXIS - let's call Claude API directly like regular chat does!

TASK:
Update /api/lesson/<lesson_id>/ai-chat endpoint to stream directly 
from Claude API instead of calling AXIS backend.

COPY THE APPROACH FROM REGULAR CHAT:
Show me how the regular chat endpoint streams from Claude API,
then apply the SAME approach to lesson chat.

The only differences for lesson chat should be:
1. Get lesson context from database (lesson title, content)
2. Include enhanced personality prompt
3. Stream response from Claude API

NO AXIS BACKEND NEEDED!

EXPECTED CODE:
@app.route('/api/lesson/<int:lesson_id>/ai-chat', methods=['POST'])
def lesson_chat(lesson_id):
    question = request.json['question']
    
    # Get lesson context from database
    lesson = db.execute("SELECT * FROM curriculum WHERE lesson_id = ?", 
                       (lesson_id,)).fetchone()
    
    # Build enhanced prompt with personality
    prompt = f"""[Enhanced personality system prompt]
    
    Current lesson: {lesson['lesson_title']}
    Student question: {question}
    """
    
    # Stream from Claude API (like regular chat does!)
    def generate():
        client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
        with client.messages.stream(
            model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
            max_tokens=1500,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
        ) as stream:
            for text in stream.text_stream:
                yield f"data: {text}\n\n"
    
    return Response(
        generate(),
        mimetype='text/event-stream',
        headers={
            'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
            'X-Accel-Buffering': 'no'
        }
    )

Just copy what regular chat does and adapt it for lesson context!

This will make lesson chat stream word-by-word like ChatGPT! 🚀

✅ WHAT THIS FIXES:
Before (with AXIS):
User → Flask → AXIS → Claude → AXIS → Flask → User
                 ↑              ↓
           Buffers here!    Returns all at once
After (direct):
User → Flask → Claude → streams → User
                  ↑
            Streams directly! ✅
Result: Word-by-word streaming like ChatGPT! 🎉
