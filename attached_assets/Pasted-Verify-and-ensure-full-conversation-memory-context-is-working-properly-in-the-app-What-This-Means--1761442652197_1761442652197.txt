Verify and ensure full conversation memory/context is working properly in the app.
What This Means:
The AI should remember everything said in the current conversation and be able to reference it in later responses. This is critical for coherent, contextual conversations.
Test Cases to Verify:
	1.	Start a new chat
	2.	Tell the AI something specific (e.g., “My girlfriend is an INFJ”)
	3.	Send several more messages (5-10) about different topics
	4.	Ask the AI to recall the earlier information (e.g., “What type did I say my girlfriend was?”)
	5.	The AI should correctly reference the earlier message
Requirements:
On the backend:
	•	When sending a message to Claude API, include the full conversation history in the request
	•	Format: Array of messages with role (user/assistant) and content
	•	Include ALL previous messages in the chat, not just the last few
	•	Maintain proper message ordering (chronological)
Context Window Management:
	•	Claude Sonnet has ~200k token context window
	•	For most personal use, this is plenty - don’t truncate conversation history unless it exceeds this limit
	•	If conversation gets extremely long (rare), keep recent messages and truncate older ones, but warn user
Persistence:
	•	When user leaves chat and comes back, load the full conversation history from database
	•	When app reloads, conversation context should be preserved
	•	User shouldn’t have to “remind” the AI of things said earlier in the same conversation
What NOT to do:
	•	Don’t send only the last message (no context)
	•	Don’t send only last 5-10 messages (limited context)
	•	Don’t reset context when user leaves and returns to chat
	•	Don’t forget to include system prompt in every API call
Testing:
Create a test conversation where:
	1.	Message 1: “My name is Jeralyn”
	2.	Messages 2-10: Various MBTI questions
	3.	Message 11: “What’s my name?”
	4.	Leave the chat, come back, and ask again: “Do you remember my name?”
The AI should remember “Jeralyn” both times. If it doesn’t, conversation memory is broken.
Common Issues to Check:
	•	Is conversation history being loaded from database when reopening a chat?
	•	Is the full message array being sent to Claude API on each request?
	•	Are messages being saved to database correctly?
	•	Is there a bug truncating message history somewhere?
Make sure the app passes the name test above before considering this complete.
