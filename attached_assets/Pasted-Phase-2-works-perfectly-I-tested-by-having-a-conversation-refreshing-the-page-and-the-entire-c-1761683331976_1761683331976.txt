Phase 2 works perfectly! ✅

I tested by having a conversation, refreshing the page, and the entire conversation loaded with full context preserved. The AI remembered everything.

Ready to move to Phase 3: Complete Sidebar & Organization

Please add:

**Sidebar Structure:**
- Collapsible sidebar (default: open on desktop, closed on mobile)
- Burger menu button (☰) to toggle open/closed
- Width: 280px on desktop, full-screen slide-in on mobile

**IMPORTANT - Burger Menu Behavior:**
- When sidebar is CLOSED: Burger menu (☰) visible
- When sidebar is OPEN: Burger menu HIDES or moves inside sidebar (not blocking content)
- The burger should never overlap or block the "New Chat" button
- On desktop: Burger can stay visible but positioned properly, or transform to X (close) icon
- On mobile: Burger should transform to X (close) icon when sidebar opens

**Top Section:**
- "New Chat" button (prominent, always visible at top of sidebar)
- Clicking creates new conversation, defaults to "Brain Dump" folder, and switches to it immediately

**Folder Organization:**
8 collapsible project folders in this exact order:
1. 💕 Relationship Lab
2. 🎓 MBTI Academy
3. 🔍 Type Detective
4. 📈 Trading Psychology
5. 🎯 PM Playbook
6. ⚡ Quick Hits
7. 🧠 Brain Dump
8. 📋 All Chats (at bottom, with divider line above it)

Note: "All Chats" is a special view-only folder that shows all conversations from all folders. It's not a real folder - moving a chat from "All Chats" moves it from its current folder to the selected folder.

Each folder displays:
- Number of chats in parentheses: "Relationship Lab (3)"
- Expand/collapse arrow indicator (▶/▼)
- List of conversations when expanded
- Empty folders show "No chats yet" in greyed out text

**Conversation Display:**
Each conversation in list shows:
- First 40 characters of first message (or auto-generated title)
- Truncate with "..." if longer
- Active conversation highlighted with background color change

**Chat Management (3-Dot Menu):**
Each conversation has a menu button (⋮) that reveals:
- Rename: Click to edit inline or in popup, updates immediately
- Move to Folder: Dropdown showing the 7 project folders (NOT "All Chats")
- Delete: Shows confirmation dialog:
  Message: "Delete this conversation? This action cannot be undone."
  Buttons: "Cancel" (grey) and "Delete" (red)

**Database Updates:**
- Add `folder` field to conversations table (default: "Brain Dump")
- Add `title` field to conversations table (default: first message preview, max 40 chars)
- Update API endpoints to support folder filtering and chat management

**Initial Load Behavior:**
- On first load, automatically load the most recent conversation
- If no conversations exist, show empty chat with welcome message
- While loading conversations, show loading spinner in sidebar

**Behavior:**
- Folders remember expand/collapse state (persist in localStorage)
- Click conversation → loads it in main chat area
- Delete conversation → removes from list and database immediately (after confirmation)
- Move conversation → appears in new folder immediately
- Rename conversation → updates title immediately
- Sidebar auto-closes on mobile after selecting conversation
- New chats always default to "Brain Dump" folder

**Mobile Optimization:**
- Burger menu visible on mobile when sidebar is closed
- When sidebar opens, burger transforms to X (close) icon
- Sidebar slides in from left as full overlay
- Tap outside sidebar to close it
- All functionality works on touch (no hover-required features)
- 3-dot menu accessible via tap

**Desktop Enhancement (Optional):**
- Keyboard shortcut: Cmd/Ctrl + K to toggle sidebar (nice to have, not required)

**Test Criteria:**
I should be able to:
✅ Open sidebar - burger menu doesn't block "New Chat" button
✅ Create new chats via button (defaults to Brain Dump)
✅ See loading spinner while conversations load
✅ Expand/collapse folders
✅ See "No chats yet" in empty folders
✅ Click chat to load it in main area
✅ Most recent conversation loads automatically on first visit
✅ Rename chats (updates immediately)
✅ Move chats between folders (appears in new location, not available from "All Chats")
✅ Delete chats with proper confirmation dialog
✅ See all conversations in "All Chats" folder at bottom
✅ Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile
✅ Folder states persist across page refresh
✅ Burger menu behavior is clean (transforms to X on mobile)

This is the complete sidebar feature - all navigation and management in one cohesive phase. 🚀
