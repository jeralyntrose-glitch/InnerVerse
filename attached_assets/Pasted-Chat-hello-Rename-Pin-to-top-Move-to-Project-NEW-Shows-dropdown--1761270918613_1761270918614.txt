**Step 2: When user clicks a project:**
- Chat disappears from "Home" tab
- Chat appears in that project folder
- Show toast: "Moved to [Project Name] ✓"

**Step 3: Add a "Move to Project" button in the top bar too**

When you're actively in a chat, add a button next to the dark mode toggle:
```
Top bar: [☰] InnerVerse - hello [📁 Move] [🌙]
                                    ↑
                                   Click this
```

Shows same project list dropdown.

## How the Flow Would Work

**Current flow:**
1. User types "hello"
2. Chat auto-creates in **Home** tab
3. Chat stays there forever (cluttered)

**New flow:**
1. User types "hello" 
2. Chat auto-creates in **Home** tab
3. User realizes this is relationship advice
4. User clicks ⋮ → "Move to Project" → "Relationship Lab"
5. Chat moves to Relationship Lab folder
6. Home tab stays clean (only active/recent chats)

## Additional Feature: "Create New Project" Option

In that dropdown, also add:
```
Move to Project:
├── + Create New Project ← Add this at top
├── 💕 Relationship Lab
├── 🎓 MBTI Academy
└── ...
```

When clicked:
1. Shows input field: "Project name?"
2. Shows emoji picker (or just use default 📁)
3. Creates new project
4. Moves chat there

## Better UX: Quick Actions

Instead of just a menu, you could add **drag-and-drop**:

1. User clicks and holds a chat in Home tab
2. Sidebar shows project folders highlighted
3. User drags chat over "Relationship Lab"
4. Drops it
5. Chat moves there

But start with the menu approach - it's simpler to build.

## One More Thing: Show Project Badge

When viewing a chat that's in a project, show which project it belongs to:
```
Top bar: 
[☰] InnerVerse - hello [💕 Relationship Lab] [🌙]
                        ↑
                        Shows current project
