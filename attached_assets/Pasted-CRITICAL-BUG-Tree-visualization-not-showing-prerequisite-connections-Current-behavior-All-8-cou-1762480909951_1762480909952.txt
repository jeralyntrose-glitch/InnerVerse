CRITICAL BUG: Tree visualization not showing prerequisite connections

Current behavior:
- All 8 courses appear in a horizontal line
- No vertical connections between courses
- Ignoring prerequisite_course_id data

Expected behavior:
- Courses with no prerequisites at top (roots)
- Courses with prerequisites below their parent
- Lines connecting parent → child courses

The bug is in static/learning_paths.js in buildTreeHierarchy() function around line 200-250.

Current code treats all courses as root children:
```javascript
// WRONG - adds everything as root child
root.children.push({
    id: course.id,
    name: course.title,
    data: course
});
```

Fix needed:
```javascript
function buildTreeHierarchy(courses) {
    // Create map of courses by ID
    const courseMap = {};
    courses.forEach(course => {
        courseMap[course.id] = {
            id: course.id,
            name: course.title,
            category: course.category,
            data: course,
            children: []
        };
    });
    
    // Build parent-child relationships using prerequisite_course_id
    const rootNodes = [];
    courses.forEach(course => {
        const node = courseMap[course.id];
        
        if (course.prerequisite_course_id) {
            // Has prerequisite - add as child of parent
            const parent = courseMap[course.prerequisite_course_id];
            if (parent) {
                parent.children.push(node);
            } else {
                // Parent not found - treat as root
                rootNodes.push(node);
            }
        } else {
            // No prerequisite - this is a root node
            rootNodes.push(node);
        }
    });
    
    // Create root container
    return {
        id: 'root',
        name: 'Learning Paths',
        children: rootNodes
    };
}
```

This will create proper tree structure:
- Foundations courses at top (no prerequisites)
- Intermediate courses below their foundation
- Advanced courses below their intermediate
- Lines connecting prerequisite → dependent course

URGENT: Without this fix, the entire tree visualization feature is broken!
